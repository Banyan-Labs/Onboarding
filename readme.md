# Welcome to Banyan Labs Onboarding!

## Getting Set Up ðŸš€

First we need to get your computer set up with all the programs you'll need to succeed not just in this job, but any job in the technology field. 

The following links are to two different slide shows. Depending on what operating system you are running (Mac or Windows) select the appropiate slide show and follow the instructions.

[Windows](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vpZFRbbc3P-pTPS7f6H4ReKpIfwIdVJS_dvVKgq4FBk/edit)

[Mac](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PYGZ4R5-LaxHQGcQoBluEDn3TLoGCntjIywuEwDk6ek/edit?usp=sharing)

One last tool you might find helpful is [Github Desktop App](https://desktop.github.com/).

## First Steps - Creating a repo ðŸ’» ðŸ“‚

Good work getting through all the setup! Time to have some fun. 

You have probably heard how important documentation is in coding. Well it's true. Right now you're reading a form of documentation! Rather than listing out a bunch of steps here, let's get used to reading some real website documentation. [Let's start by creating your first repo.](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo)

If you get stuck anywhere in the tutorial, don't stressðŸ§˜. That is completely normal and part of the process. Message your Work Buddy, another coworker, or send a message on Slack asking for help. Include the number of the step you got stuck on. Asking good questions is just as important as knowing the answer.

Hopefully by this point you have made it though that first tutorial (if not, ask for help!), but you might have noticed something. You didn't write any code in an editor did you? Of course using a real code editor is something you'll want to know how to do. For that, follow our [home made instructions here.](https://github.com/Banyan-Labs/Onboarding) If you get stuck, the same rules apply. Good luck!
